# Geodesignhub Subsurface viewer
A one-click 3D viewer for viewing designs with underground features built on  Geodesignhub, using the [Cesium JS](https://cesiumjs.org) visualization library. This plugin takes design data from the [Geodesignhub API](https://www.geodesignhub.com/api) and develops a visualization that enables you to visualize overground and underground features. 

In Geodesignhub, drawing is done on a 2D map however you can specify if a feature is above or underground. This plugin reads that information and develops a visualization.
